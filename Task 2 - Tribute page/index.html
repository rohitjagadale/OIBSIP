          Warren Buffett (born in Omaha in August 1930) is considered by some to be one of the most successful investors
          in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buffett was born in 1930 in Omaha, Nebraska. He was the second of three children and the only son of Leila
          (née Stahl) and Congressman Howard Buffett, Buffett began his education at Rose Hill Elementary School. In
          1942, his father was elected to the first of four terms in the United States Congress, and after moving with
          his family to Washington, D.C., Warren finished elementary school, attended Alice Deal Junior High School and
          graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1947, where his senior yearbook picture reads: "likes math; a
          future stockbroker." After finishing high school and finding success with his side entrepreneurial and
          investment ventures, Buffett wanted to skip college to go directly into business, but was overruled by his
          father.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2008 he was ranked by Forbes as the richest person in the world with an estimated net worth of
          approximately US$62 billion. In 2009, after donating billions of dollars to charity, Buffett was ranked as the
          second richest man in the United States with a net worth of US$37 billion with only Bill Gates ranked higher
          than Buffett. His net worth had risen to $58.5 billion as of September 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, Buffett was named the top money manager of the Twentieth Century in a survey by the Carson Group,
          ahead of Peter Lynch and John Templeton. In 2007, he was listed among Time's 100 Most Influential People in
          the world. In 2011, President Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Most recently,
          Buffett, along with Bill Gates, was named the most influential global thinker in Foreign Policy's 2010 report.
        </p>
        <p>
          Buffett has written several times of his belief that, in a market economy, the rich earn outsized rewards for
          their talents. His children will not inherit a significant proportion of his wealth. He once commented, "I
          want to give my kids just enough so that they would feel that they could do anything, but not so much that
          they would feel like doing nothing".
        </p>
        <p>
          Buffett had long stated his intention to give away his fortune to charity, and in June 2006, he announced a
          new plan to give 83% of it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He pledged about the equivalent of 10
          million Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (worth approximately US$30.7
          billion as of June 23, 2006) making it the largest charitable donation in history, and Buffett one of the
          leaders of philanthrocapitalism. The foundation will receive 5% of the total each July, beginning in 2006.
          (The pledge is conditional upon the foundation's giving away each year, beginning in 2009, an amount that is
          at least equal to the value of the entire previous year's gift from Buffett, in addition to 5% of the
          foundation's net assets.) Buffett joined the Gates Foundation's board, but did not plan to be actively
          involved in the foundation's investments.
        </p>
        <p>
          This represented a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, to the effect that most of his
          fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation. The bulk of the estate of his wife, valued at $2.6 billion, went
          there when she died in 2004. He also pledged $50 million to the Nuclear Threat Initiative, in Washington,
          where he began serving as an adviser in 2002.
